# React Through Time

This project follows the evolution of a small React application over the last 8 years. It documents the changes and shifts to JavaScript and it's ecosystem and it's exponential rise in popularity since I wrote my first React Tube Tracker app back in [2014](https://www.matthinchliffe.dev/2014/03/05/building-robust-web-apps-with-react-part-1.html).

The project currently has 3 installments, with each revision of the app based on the previous one:

1. [2014: React v0.12, ES5, Node.js v0.10, React's own JSX transform tools.](https://github.com/i-like-robots/react-through-time/pull/1)
2. [2016: React v15, ES6, Node.js v6, Webpack and Babel.](https://github.com/i-like-robots/react-through-time/pull/2)
3. [2020: React v17, ES2020, Node.js v14, ESBuild.](https://github.com/i-like-robots/react-through-time/pull/3)

Each iteration is presented as a [pull request](https://github.com/i-like-robots/react-through-time/pulls) so that the code between them can be compared and is accompanied by a rambling commentary where I share some contextual information and some of my perspective too.
